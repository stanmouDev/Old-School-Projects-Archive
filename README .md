# Old School Projects Archive

This repository contains early projects I created during my learning phase in software development.

The purpose of this archive is to:
- Show the progress Iâ€™ve made over time
- Keep a record of foundational experiments
- Reflect my growth from basic to more advanced coding

### Contents
Each folder in this repo represents a different beginner-level project, including:
- Simple HTML & CSS pages
- JavaScript practice apps
- School assignments or test projects

These projects may not follow best practices, but they helped shape my skills. I now focus on building more advanced and professional software.
